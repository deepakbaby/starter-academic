absract = "In classical computational neuroscience, analytical model descriptions are derived from neuronal recordings to mimic the underlying biological system. These neuronal models are typically slow to com    pute and cannot be integrated within large-scale neuronal simulation frameworks. We present a hybrid, machine-learning and computational-neuroscience approach that transforms analytical models of sensory neurons and sy    napses into deep-neural-network (DNN) neuronal units with the same biophysical properties. Our DNN-model architecture comprises parallel and differentiable equations that can be used for backpropagation in neuro-engine    ering applications, and offers a simulation run-time improvement factor of 70 and 280 on CPU or GPU systems respectively. We focussed our development on auditory neurons and synapses, and show that our DNN-model archit    ecture can be extended to a variety of existing analytical models. We describe how our approach for auditory models can be applied to other neuron and synapse types to help accelerate the development of large-scale bra    in networks and DNN-based treatments of the pathological system."
