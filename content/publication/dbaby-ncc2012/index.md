abstract = "Compressed Sensing deals with recovering sparse signals from a relatively small number of linear measurements. Several algorithms exists for data recovery from the compressed measurements, particularly appealing among these is the greedy approach known as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). In this paper, we propose a modified OMP based algorithm called Ordered Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (Ordered OMP). Ordered OMP is conceptually simpler and provides an improved performance when compared to OMP."
