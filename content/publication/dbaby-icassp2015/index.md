abstract = "Deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic modelling has been successfully used for a variety of automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, thanks to its ability to learn higher-level information using multiple hidden layers. This paper investigates the recently proposed exemplar-based speech enhancement technique using coupled dictionaries as a pre-processing stage for DNN-based systems. In this setting, the noisy speech is decomposed as a weighted sum of atoms in an input dictionary containing exemplars sampled from a domain of choice, and the resulting weights are applied to a coupled output dictionary containing exemplars sampled in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain to directly obtain the speech and noise estimates for speech enhancement. In this work, settings using input dictionary of exemplars sampled from the STFT, Mel-integrated magnitude STFT and modulation envelope spectra are evaluated. Experiments performed on the AURORA-4 database revealed that these pre-processing stages can improve the performance of the DNN-HMM-based ASR systems with both clean and multi-condition training."
