abstract = "In exemplar-based speech enhancement systems, lower dimensional features are preferred over the full-scale DFT features for their reduced computational complexity and the ability to better generalize for the unseen cases. But in order to obtain the Wiener-like filter for noisy DFT enhancement, the speech and noise estimates obtained in the feature space need to be mapped to the DFT space, which yield a low-rank approximation of the estimates resulting in a sub-optimal filter. This paper proposes a novel method using coupled dictionaries where the exemplars for the required feature space and the DFT space are jointly extracted and the estimates are directly obtained in the DFT space following the decomposition in the chosen feature space. Simulation experiments revealed that the proposed approach, where the activations of exemplars calculated using the Mel resolution are directly used to obtain the Wiener filter in the DFT space, results in improved signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) when compared to the system without coupled dictionaries. To further motivate the use of coupled dictionaries, the paper also investigates the use of modulation envelope features for the exemplar-based speech enhancement."
